# Infusing an eCommerce app with AI

## Session Description

In this session we will explore how to enhance an eCommerce application using AI. We will start by introducing the eShopLite application, a frontend app built with Blazor and a backend app with .NET API. Our goal is to implement a search feature that uses AI to enable a natural language search experience for users.

In this session, we will dive into the building process, providing an overview of AI models and introducing Semantic Kernel as the key component to connect everything. We will add AI services to the main app, explain the main changes, and run the BackEnd to test the smart search functionality.

Finally, we will review and explain the main concepts covered in the session, including Semantic Kernel, the deployed models, and Prompty, with an optional Q&A session to address any questions from the audience.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the integration of LLM-based AI into new or existing applications using .NET and Azure AI Services.
- Learn the tools, libraries, and best practices for incorporating LLMs into intelligent applications.
- Gain practical experience with Prompty.

## Technology Used

The technologies used in the session are:

- Blazor: Used for the frontend application.
- .NET API: Used for the backend application.
- AI Models: GPT-4o and Ada002 for embeddings.
- Semantic Kernel: Key component to connect everything.
- Prompty: Used for search functionality.
- Visual Studio Code: Used for Prompty usage and lifecycle.
- Aspire: Used for analysis and demo details.
